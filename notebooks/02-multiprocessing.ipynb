    "# Python Multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python allows us to execute multiple processes in parallel, enabling us to leverage multiple CPU cores on a single machine to parallelize our code. Whilst distributed computation in general is a complicated and nuanced subject particularly when we begin to consider interprocess communications or even inter-machine communications on distributed systems, it doesn't mean we can't use and benefit from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processes vs. Threads\n",
    "A `Process` is an individual execution of code within a PVM and has it's own memory space. A `Thread` on the other hand shares memory with other threads and runs on the same process. Each of these will have its own benefits, generally multiprocessing is good for CPU bound tasks whilst multithreading is good for I/O bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically this is because the global interpreter lock of Python restricts code execution to one thread at a time within the Python virtual machine which limits threading for CPU bound tasks, but multiprocessing bypasses this issue."
